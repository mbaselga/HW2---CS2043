to
mrs
saville
england
my
dear
sister
i
write
a
few
lines
in
haste
to
say
that
i
am
safe
and
well
advanced
on
my
voyage
this
letter
will
reach
england
by
a
merchantman
now
on
its
homeward
voyage
from
archangel
more
fortunate
than
i
who
may
not
see
my
native
land
perhaps
for
many
years
i
am
however
in
good
spirits
my
men
are
bold
and
apparently
firm
of
purpose
nor
do
the
floating
sheets
of
ice
that
continually
pass
us
indicating
the
dangers
of
the
region
towards
which
we
are
advancing
appear
to
dismay
them
we
have
already
reached
a
very
high
latitude
but
it
is
the
height
of
summer
and
although
not
so
warm
as
in
england
the
southern
gales
which
blow
us
speedily
towards
those
shores
which
i
so
ardently
desire
to
attain
breathe
a
degree
of
renovating
warmth
which
i
had
not
expected
no
incidents
have
hitherto
befallen
us
that
would
make
a
figure
in
a
letter
one
or
two
stiff
gales
and
the
springing
of
a
leak
are
accidents
which
experienced
navigators
scarcely
remember
to
record
and
i
shall
be
well
content
if
nothing
worse
happen
to
us
during
our
voyage
adieu
my
dear
margaret
be
assured
that
for
my
own
sake
as
well
as
yours
i
will
not
rashly
encounter
danger
i
will
be
cool
persevering
and
prudent
but
success
shall
crown
my
endeavours
wherefore
not
thus
far
i
have
gone
tracing
a
secure
way
over
the
pathless
seas
the
very
stars
themselves
being
witnesses
and
testimonies
of
my
triumph
why
not
still
proceed
over
the
untamed
yet
obedient
element
what
can
stop
the
determined
heart
and
resolved
will
of
man
my
swelling
heart
involuntarily
pours
itself
out
thus
but
i
must
finish
heaven
bless
my
beloved
sister
